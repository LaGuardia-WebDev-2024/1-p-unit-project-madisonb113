    <h1>Read and Learn to Let Go</h1>

    <p>
      This is a guide on things that you can do to relax the mind and body. It is <em> important</em> to let the body rest. At times, we tend to get overwhelmed with our daily jobs, people, schools, etc. This can hinder us from being present and getting what we need done. At times, we all need a break.

  </body> Taking a day for yourself is always beneficial. It feels good to finally slow down after constantly going being busy. Consistent and hard work is imperative, although, sometimes we just need to <em>rest</em>.
